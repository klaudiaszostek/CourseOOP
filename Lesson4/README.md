The diagram should model the behavior of the system consistent with the chosen topic:
- 15 or more non-trivial classes (a class is considered trivial if it does not contain
any unique methods or fields/properties, unless it is part of a polymorphic hierarchy with appropriate comments).
- 10 or more instances of inheritance/implementation/aggregation/composition.
- In places that are unclear or ambiguous - additional comments.
