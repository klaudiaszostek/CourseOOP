# 3

Programmer Marek has received another order to write a program simulating a sea voyage, this time for different types of submarines. He intends to approach the new project in a systematic manner and in accordance with the principles of software designâ€¦

You have existing files: the class diagram with comments, and the finished code for several program classes, including the main Program class and the classes responsible for testing. Please create the remaining classes in such a way as to obtain a working program consistent with the assumptions of the diagram. The unspecified cases can be supplemented at your own discretion.

Before starting the actual simulation, the program elements will be automatically tested by the TestSubmarine class. If the result of all tests is positive, you should uncomment the Submarine.Demo(); command in the Program class and the contents of the Submarine class.
