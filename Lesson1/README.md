The topic of inheritance hierarchy: Pirate Ship

1. The hierarchy should contain at least five classes arranged in at least three levels of inheritance (i.e. there must be
at least one situation where A inherits from B and B inherits from C).

2. After designing the hierarchy, please implement it in the code, equipping each class with at least one constructor based on the base keyword. The exception is the base class at the very top of the hierarchy, where, of course, a constructor without the base keyword should be used.
